# Home for Continuous Integration Scripts

Scripts for automatically building Meshroom in different environments.

Please add enough information that an end user could manually execute these scripts to create their own trunk build/dev environment.

This is an initial attempt to get things running.

Long term goal will be to pull common code into shared scripts.
